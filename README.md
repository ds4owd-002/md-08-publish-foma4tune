Inititially encounter 404 page error after creating and deploying the github page. Thanks to Adriana for assistance in checking the files and instructing me to render again the file in posit Rstudio and to commit the file. I followed the instruction and had to add a desciption before commit,also i had to use the terminal in Posit Rstudio to globally configure my email and username, which ensure i commit successfully and then push. Now, the github page website is up and running.
